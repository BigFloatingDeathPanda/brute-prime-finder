Brute-force prime number finder from 2 to n.

This program uses an inefficient brute-force algorithm to locate prime numbers.
The algorithm is quite slow when checking for primes at or above 10,000 or so.
A more efficient algorithm is needed in such a case.

Update: Added list of palindromic primes to the bottom of the list.
Update: Bug fix.  Will correctly find single digit palindrome primes now.
