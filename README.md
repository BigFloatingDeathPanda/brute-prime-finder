Brute-force prime number finder from 2 to n.

This program uses an inefficient brute-force algorithm to locate prime numbers.
The algorithm is quite slow when chacking for primes at or above 10,000 or so.
A more efficient algorithm is needed in such a case.

TO DO: Research 
    -Quadratic Sieve
    -General Number Field Sieve
    -Really, just come back to this later (or never) since brute force was the goal.
